# Tic Tac Toe Game in C++

## Introduction
This repository contains a simple, console-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C++. The game is designed for two players to compete against each other.

## Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code.
3. Compile the source code using your C++ compiler. For example, if you're using GCC, you can use the command `g++ -o tictactoe tictactoe.cpp`.
4. Run the compiled program. If you're using a Unix-like operating system, you can use the command `./tictactoe`.

## Gameplay
The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. Two players take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid with X or O marks. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
